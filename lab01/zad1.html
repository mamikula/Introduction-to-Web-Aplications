    <p id="akapit2">
        Został po raz pierwszy użyty w XV w. przez nieznanego drukarza do wypełnienia tekstem próbnej
        książki.
    </p>

    <p id="akapit3">
        Pięć wieków później zaczął być używany przemyśle elektronicznym, pozostając praktycznie
        niezmienionym.

    <p id="akapit4">
        Spopularyzował się w latach 60. XX w. wraz z
        publikacją arkuszy Letrasetu, zawierających fragmenty
        Lorem Ipsum, a ostatnio z zawierającym różne wersje

                    is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
                    consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
                    to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which
                    toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever
                    undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
                    right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or
                    one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? he master-builder of human happiness. "
